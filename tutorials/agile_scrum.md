# Systems development life cycle (or SDLC or application development life-cycle)
It's a general term for all below titles.

# Çevik proje yönetimi (or Agile project management)
It's a type of project (not necessarily software project) management. It's suitable for projects which:
- not have well defined requirements,
- are open for change,
- are complex.

Agile manifesto is as following:

Turkish:

```
Bizler daha iyi yazılım geliştirme yollarını

uygulayarak ve başkalarının da uygulamasına yardım ederek ortaya çıkartıyoruz.

Bu çalışmaların sonucunda:

Süreçler ve araçlardan ziyade bireyler ve etkileşimlere

Kapsamlı dökümantasyondan ziyade çalışan yazılıma

Sözleşme pazarlıklarından ziyade müşteri ile işbirliğine

Bir plana bağlı kalmaktan ziyade değişime karşılık vermeye

değer vermeye kanaat getirdik.

Özetle, sol taraftaki maddelerin değerini kabul etmekle birlikte,

sağ taraftaki maddeleri daha değerli bulmaktayız.
```

English:

```
 We are uncovering better ways of developing

software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on

the right, we value the items on the left more.
```

# Scrum
kelime anlamı: itişip kakışma, saldırı

There is no any special word in Turkish for Agile.

It's fork of the Agile. It defines the terms like 'sprint' (kelime anlamı: sürat koşusu), 'backlog' (kelime anlamı: rezerv, birikim), 'daily meetings' etc. It is designed only for software projects.

Generally Scrum defines more details about the management process. But Agile is set of abstract principles comparing to Scrum. Some examples to understand that difference:
- Agile defines that face to face communication is required. But Scrum defines that the customers should work with developers.
- Agile defines the iterations, but Scrum defines the 'sprint'.
- Agile points out that visualizing is important, but Scrum defines 'scrum board'.

Analysis had to be sent to developers before sprint starts. The developers should read the analysis after the retrospective meeting and before giving them story points.

Scrum's guide is being updated. Changes are made in the flow and phrases. The 2020 version is here:

(source-id: 81)

(source-id: 82)

Other versions are here: (source-id: 83)

It is a business fable. It was also mentioned in the official "Scrum Guide" but it has been removed on the new versions.

The chicken and pig decided to open a restaurant. They both should serve a food to customer as partners. The chicken had to serve his eggs and the pig had to serve meat which will be part of itself. In the bottom line; The Chicken is involved, but the Pig commits. This situation is simulated on Scrum framework as: the Development Team, Product Owners & Scrum Masters are considered as people who are committed to the project while stakeholders, customers and executive management are considered as involved but not committed to the project.

# Kanban
- It's a fork of Agile.
- The main focus of Kanban is the visualization of tasks. So everyone can see an predict the failures.
- Below are the differences between Kanban comparing to Scrum:
  - There are no specific meeting and activity definitions on Kanban. But on any bottlenecks the team decides to any new action. On each project the progress improves itself.
  - On Kanban, to giving estimations is optional.
  - On Kanban, there is no definitions of roles (like Scrum Master etc).
  - On Kanban, the iteration is optional. On Agile, the "iteration" is mandatory and it's equals to "sprint".

# Extreme programming (or XP)
- It's a fork of Agile. It designed only for software projects.
- Below factors have high priority on XP:
  - quality of code is important. Therefore in some cases refactoring tasks has high priority.
  - Test-driven development
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
  - Small releases
  - Simple design

# WaterFall Model (or Şelale modeli)
- It's not a fork of Agile.
- Code of entire project is designing after the analysis. The analysis should be ready completely.
- It is not eligible in current era. Because to prepare all analysis takes really long time and in that preparing period, customer needs may change. Also sometimes the customer does not know what we wants. At Scrum, the customer follows/joins the development progress and demonstrations of each sprint. So he can see whats going on, and he can make dicisions on the development period.
- Whole project can be separated in steps/periods. In this case, end of each these periods called milestone (kilometre taşı, dönüm noktası)

# Lean software development (or yalın yazılım geliştirme)
-  Very first usage of "Lean product development" is the name of the culture of production environment of Toyota fabric. After that, Mary Poppendieck ve Tom Poppendieck wrote a book in 2003 called "lean software development"  which adapt this culture to software project.
- Lean software development generally based on YAGNI and optimized development systems.
